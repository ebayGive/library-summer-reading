</p>

<h4>Using the Activity Grid</h4>
<ul>
<li>Go to the "Play" tab to see the activity grid.</li>
<li>Mouse-over a square to view activities.</li>
<li>Click on a square to open it. When you have completed the activity, move the "I did it!" switch from "No" to "Yes" and click the "Save" button. If you have not completed the activity, click "Cancel" to return to your Activity Grid.</li>
<li>Optional: write a note about what you did.</li>
<li>Complete any 4 squares in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) to receive a prize.</li>
<li>Fill in all the squares ("blackout") to earn an entry into a prize drawing.</li> 
<li>Any of the squares on the Activity Grid may be replaced by the following reading activities: 
<ul>
<li>Pre-Readers = "Read/sing/talk with your child for 20 minutes"</li>
<li>Readers, Teens, and Adults = "Read a book or magazine"</li>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Read</h3>
<p>Challenge yourself to read for 20 minutes a day! Keep track of the time you spend reading using the Reading Tracker. </p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the "Read" tab to see the Reading Tracker.</li>
<li>For every 20 minutes you read, click on the "Add 20 Minutes" button. This will automatically fill in a 20 minute square. Click the "Remove 20 Minutes" button if you make a mistake.</li>
<li>All reading counts: reading can be done anywhere, and using any format. Families reading aloud together can count these minutes for everyone.</li>
<li>If you fill your Reading Tracker (10 hours), you’ll reveal special artwork and win a prize.</li>
<li>After filling your first Reading Tracker you can start another to reveal different artwork.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Win</h3>
